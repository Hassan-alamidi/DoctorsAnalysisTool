These R scripts are used to tansform the data from synthetic Health 
to match my database schema, these scripts will do this by getting the output
from synthetic health transforming them and posting them to the actual server
where the server will then store them in the database.
This will also act as a good way of testing how the server handles a large 
amount of data in a short amount of time.
